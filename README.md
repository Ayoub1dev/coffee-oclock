## My process
  I have done the desktop version first by using media queries then I have developed the mobile version without @media.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I have learnt how to used the JS I have learnt to make an accordion and i have got an idea of how to use js fr future projects.


```js
acc[i].addEventListener('click',function(){.,..}
```

### Continued development

I would like to use more JS to make animations and 3D web graphics, and also learn how to close an open accordion when another accordion is oppened.
